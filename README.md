# byo-cpp-Redis
Create you your own Redis Server using C++.  Following along tutorial found in [build-your-own-x repo](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x?tab=readme-ov-file#build-your-own-database).

## What You'll Learn
Being able to code this project from scratch will teach you:

1. **Network Programming:** The next level of programming is programming for multiple machines. Think HTTP servers, RPCs, databases, distributed systems.

2. **Data Structures:** Redis is the best example of applying data structures to real-world problems. Why stop at theoretical, textbook-level knowledge when you can learn from production software?  I decided to complete this project to familiarize myself their various use cases beyond *LeetCode* problems.

3. **Low-level C:** C was, is, and will be widely used for systems programming and infrastructure software. It’s a gateway to many low-level projects.  This project will allow me apply my knowledge of C/C++ while picking up new concepts along the way.


**Current Progress:**

Created TCP server and client code

## To compile Server
g++ -Wall -Wextra -g server.cpp -o server

## To compile Client
g++ -Wall -Wextra -g client.cpp -o client
